This is the phrase editor.

<ul>
<li>
Phrase names start with '#', <span class="lhslink">#like_this</span>.

</li><li>
To edit your own phrases, search existing phrases by name and then duplicate them using the "menu" button in the top-right of each phrase;
or add a new phrase, using the "new phrase" button at the bottom left of the screen.

</li><li>
A phrase can have multiple definitions, each of which can reference other phrases.

</li><li>
Click on the phrase's name to edit it; click on any of the definitions to edit them;
or click on the "plus" and "trash can" buttons to add/duplicate definitions ("plus") or remove definitions ("trash can").

</li><li>
Once you start editing a phrase, you own it until you release it.
When you have released it, then you can hide it from view.
Of course, when you have released a phrase, others can also edit (and thereby lock) it.

</li><li>
There is no way to delete a phrase (although you can delete all its definitions).

</li><li>
Use the "Show sample text" option under the "menu" button to generate random text output using the relevant phrase definitions.

</li></ul>
