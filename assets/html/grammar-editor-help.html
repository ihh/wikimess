  Phrase names can include alphanumeric characters (case-insensitive) or underscores.
  When they occur in text, they are often preceded by the 'PHRASE' symbol, like this: <span class="lhslink">PHRASEdog</span>

  You can think of the 'PHRASE' symbol in <span class="lhslink">PHRASEdog</span> as meaning '<span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>ynonym for';
  as in, <i>"insert a random synonym for 'dog' at this point in the text"</i>.
  The thesaurus allows you (or anyone else) to edit the list of synonyms for 'dog'.
  The synonym definitions for a phrase can, themselves, refer to synonyms of other phrases;
  so, for example, one of the synonyms for 'dog' might be PHRASEterrier,
  which in turn would be expanded to one of the synonyms for 'terrier', presumably different breeds of terrier.

  To edit your own phrases, search existing phrases by name and then duplicate them using the menu button <span class="helpicon" icon="menu"/> in the top-right of each phrase;
  or add a new phrase, using the "new phrase" button <span class="helpicon" icon="new"/> at the bottom left of the screen.

  A phrase can have multiple definitions, each of which can reference other phrases.

</div><div>
  Tap on the phrase's name to edit it; tap on any of the definitions to edit them;
  or tap on the <span class="helpicon" icon="create"/> and <span class="helpicon" icon="delete"/> buttons to add/duplicate definitions with <span class="helpicon" icon="create"/> or remove definitions with <span class="helpicon" icon="delete"/>.

  Once you start editing a phrase, you own it, preventing others from editing it.
  Your ownership continues by default until (and if) you unlock the phrase, which you can do from the menu <span class="helpicon" icon="menu"/>.
  Even after you've unlocked a phrase, you'll still be able to see it in that session.
  You can, if you want, hide it from view, again using the menu; you can then search for it using the search tool, to bring it back into view again.
  At any point, you can edit the phrase to re-assert ownership of it.
  Of course, once you have unlocked a phrase, others can also edit (and thereby lock) it.

</div><div>
  There is no way to delete a phrase (although you can delete all its definitions).

  Use the "Show sample text" option under the menu button <span class="helpicon" icon="menu"/> to generate random text output using the relevant phrase definitions.
