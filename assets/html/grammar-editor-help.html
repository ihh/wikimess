To edit your own phrases, search existing phrases by name and then duplicate them using the menu button <span class="helpicon" icon="menu"/> in the top-right of each phrase;
or add a new phrase, using the "new phrase" button <span class="helpicon" icon="new"/> at the bottom left of the screen.

A phrase can have multiple definitions, each of which can reference other phrases.

</div><div>
Tap on the phrase's name to edit it; tap on any of the definitions to edit them;
or tap on the <span class="helpicon" icon="create"/> and <span class="helpicon" icon="delete"/> buttons to add/duplicate definitions with <span class="helpicon" icon="create"/> or remove definitions with <span class="helpicon" icon="delete"/>.

  Once you start editing a phrase, you own it, preventing others from editing it.
  Your ownership continues by default until (and if) you unlock the phrase, which you can do from the menu <span class="helpicon" icon="menu"/>.
  Even after you've unlocked a phrase, you'll still be able to see it in that session.
  You can, if you want, hide it from view, again using the menu; you can then search for it using the search tool, to bring it back into view again.
  At any point, you can edit the phrase to re-assert ownership of it.
  Of course, once you have unlocked a phrase, others can also edit (and thereby lock) it.

There is no way to delete a phrase (although you can delete all its definitions).

</div><div>
Use the "Show sample text" option under the menu button <span class="helpicon" icon="menu"/> to generate random text output using the relevant phrase definitions.
