    The editor interface is split into three main regions: the <em>Template text</em> (top), the <em>Suggestions</em> (middle), and the message card itself (bottom).
  <p>
    If you are logged in (via the settings tab <span class="helpicon" icon="settings-tab"/>), you may also choose whether
    you want a <em>Public</em> or a <em>Direct</em> message, and if the latter, you will need to specify a recipient.

  <p>
    The <em>Template text</em> can include regular text as well as <em>synonym expansions</em>, which must be preceded by the 'PHRASE' symbol, like this: <span class="lhslink">PHRASEan_example_phrase</span>
  <p>
    This will look up 'an_example_phrase' in the thesaurus, and (if an entry for that phrase exists) it will randomly select one of the synonyms defined for that phrase, and insert that random definition into the <em>Message text</em>.

    To add to a message, open the editor <span class="helpicon" icon="edit"/> and tap one of the phrases in the <em>Suggestions</em> region.

    The panel that pops up when you tap <span class="helpicon" icon="share"/> also allows you
    to share using Twitter <img class="helpicon" src="/images/twitter.png"/> or Facebook <img class="helpicon" src="/images/facebook.png"/>

    When you are logged in, sharing sends a direct message to another player's mailbox <span class="helpicon" icon="mailbox-tab"/>
  <p>
    Alternatively, you can just copy the message to the clipboard <span class="helpicon" icon="copy to clipboard"/>
