    If you are logged in (via the settings tab <span class="helpicon" icon="settings-tab"/> which is revealed if you tap the top of the screen), you may also choose whether
    you want a <em>Public</em> or a <em>Direct</em> message, and if the latter, you will need to specify a recipient.

  <p>
    The <em>Template text</em> can include regular text as well as <em>synonym expansions</em>, which must be preceded by the 'PHRASE' symbol, like this: <span class="lhslink">PHRASEan_example_phrase</span>
  <p>
    This will look up 'an_example_phrase' in the thesaurus, and (if an entry for that phrase exists) it will randomly select one of the synonyms defined for that phrase, and insert that random definition into the card.

    To add to the text on a card, or to edit it, open the editor <span class="helpicon" icon="edit"/> and tap one of the phrases in the <em>Suggestions</em> region.

    When you are logged in, sharing sends a direct message to another player's mailbox <span class="helpicon" icon="mailbox-tab"/>
  <p>
    Alternatively, you can just copy the message to the clipboard <span class="helpicon" icon="copy to clipboard"/>
