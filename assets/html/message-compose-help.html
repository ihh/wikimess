  This is the help text for the message composer tab <span class="helpicon" icon="compose-tab"/>. The message composer allows you to build messages consisting of phrases and text.
  You build the messages either by tapping on suggested phrases (i.e. an auto-suggest), or by directly typing in text.

Tap <span class="helpicon" icon="close"/> to close the help pane at any point, and tap <span class="helpicon" icon="help"/> to bring it back.

  The composer is split into three main regions: the <em>Input text</em> (top), the <em>Suggestions</em> (middle), and the <em>Expanded text</em> (bottom).
  If you are logged in (via the settings tab <span class="helpicon" icon="settings-tab"/>), you will also see an area above the <em>Input text</em> for private messaging options.
</div>

<div>
  The <em>Input text</em> can include regular text as well as <em>phrases</em>.
  Phrase names can include alphanumeric characters (case-insensitive) or underscores, and must be preceded by the 'PHRASE' symbol, like this: <span class="lhslink">PHRASEan_example_phrase</span>

  <div>
    To add to the <em>Input text</em>, tap one of the phrases in the <em>Suggestions</em> region.
    To delete a phrase added in this way, tap the <span class="helpicon" icon="backspace"/> which appears in <em>Suggestions</em>.
    Alternately, tap <span class="helpicon" icon="edit"/> to edit the <em>Input text</em> manually with the keyboard, or just tap the <em>Input text</em> itself
    (but be careful not to tap a phrase link in the <em>Input text</em>, as this will take you to the definition for that phrase in the phrasebook tab <span class="helpicon" icon="grammar-tab"/>).

  When you change the <em>Input text</em>, the <em>Expanded text</em> is automatically (and randomly) updated using the definitions in the phrase book.
  The update of the <em>Expanded text</em> is a random generative process, and may not come out the same way twice.
  If you don't happen to like how it came out, you can at any time tap <span class="helpicon" icon="re-roll"/> for another roll of the dice to re-randomize the <em>Expanded text</em>.

  When you are satisfied with the <em>Expanded text</em>, tap <span class="helpicon" icon="share"/> to post it.
