  This is the help text for the message composer tab <span class="helpicon" icon="compose-tab"/>. The message composer allows you to build messages consisting of text and synonym expansions from the thesaurus.
  You build the messages either by tapping on one of the auto-suggestions, or by directly typing in text.

  By default, the view above shows a message card.
  Swipe left or tap <span class="helpicon" icon="shuffle"/> to throw away this card and deal a new card.
  Swipe right or tap <span class="helpicon" icon="send"/> to post the message online.

  You can open up the composer by tapping <span class="helpicon" icon="edit"/>
  and close it again by tapping <span class="helpicon" icon="edit"/> again.

  The composer is split into three main regions: the <em>Template text</em> (top), the <em>Suggestions</em> (middle), and the message card itself (bottom).
  If you are logged in (via the settings tab <span class="helpicon" icon="settings-tab"/>), you may also choose whether
  you want a <em>Public</em> or a <em>Direct</em> message, and if the latter, you will need to specify a recipient.
</div>

<div>
  The <em>Template text</em> can include regular text as well as <em>synonym expansions</em>, which must be preceded by the 'PHRASE' symbol, like this: <span class="lhslink">PHRASEan_example_phrase</span>
  This will look up 'an_example_phrase' in the thesaurus, and (if an entry for that phrase exists) it will randomly select one of the synonyms defined for that phrase, and insert that random definition into the <em>Message text</em>.
  Phrase names can include alphanumeric characters (case-insensitive) or underscores.

  <div>
    To add to the <em>Template text</em>, tap one of the phrases in the <em>Suggestions</em> region.
    To delete a phrase added in this way, tap the <span class="helpicon" icon="backspace"/> which appears in <em>Suggestions</em>.
    Alternatively, tap the <em>Template text</em> window to edit the template manually with the keyboard
    (be careful not to tap a synonym-expansion link in the <em>Template text</em>, as this will take you to the definition for the corresponding phrase in the thesaurus tab <span class="helpicon" icon="grammar-tab"/>).

</div><div>
  When you change the <em>Template text</em>, the <em>Message text</em> is automatically (and randomly) updated using the definitions in the thesaurus.
  The generation of the <em>Message text</em> from the <em>Template text</em> is a random process; that is, it uses random (and potentially different) synonyms each time, so it may not come out the same way twice in a row.
  If you don't happen to like how it came out, you can at any time swipe left or tap <span class="helpicon" icon="shuffle"/> for another shuffle of the deck to re-randomize the <em>Message text</em>
  using different synonyms from the thesaurus.

  When you are satisfied with the <em>Message text</em>, swipe right or tap <span class="helpicon" icon="send"/> to post it.
  You can share using Twitter <img class="helpicon" src="/images/twitter.png"/> or Facebook <img class="helpicon" src="/images/facebook.png"/>,
  or just on this website as a public message <span class="helpicon" icon="status-tab"/>,
  or (if you are logged in) a direct message to another player's mailbox <span class="helpicon" icon="mailbox-tab"/>.
  Alternatively, you can just copy the message to the clipboard <span class="helpicon" icon="copy to clipboard"/>
  or, if you change your mind about sharing,
  you can close the share panel by tapping the close icon <span class="helpicon" icon="close"/>
  or by just tapping <span class="helpicon" icon="share"/> again.
